## Django Message Board App

<p>This repository contains a Message Board application built using Django. The application allows
  users to post and read short messages on a message board. We've utilized Django's powerful built-in admin
  interface for managing data and have added tests for ensuring code quality. The project is also configured 
  to work with multiple database backends, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQLite.</p>
